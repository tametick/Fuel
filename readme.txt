You are a space miner and your singleship has burnt out the monopoles that power its engine (also the resource you mine for). You land on a large asteroid to look for more monopoles, finding a likely looking crater you start your decent.
You need to find 5 monopoles to refuel your ship.

Controls:
* movement: arrow keys.
* fire blaster: ctrl. You can also aim your blaster in a different direction by pressing the arrow keys before releasing ctrl.
* toggle anti-grav belt: shift

See the bottom of this file for alternative controls.

Resources and tools:
The three pieces of technology you live by are your space suit, your grav-belt and your trusty laser blaster. All three of these devices run on simple fusion technology, the fuel for which is volatile ice crystals rich in oxygen, hydrogen and helium.
As you descend into the crater you will find ice formations, you can blast these to aquire ice crystals. At the end of each level you allocate these crystals to charge your suit, belt & laser as you see fit.
